# Estimating-the-area-of-the-country-using-the-population-of-the-country
Implemented a Machine Learning Pipeline for Predictive Modeling. Utilized Web Scraping to collect structured data on countries (population, area, etc.) from the Scrapethissite site using Python and the BeautifulSoup library. Then processed and stored the data in an SQLite database for efficient querying and analysis. Built and trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn to estimate a countryâ€™s area based on its population. For evaluation, I assessed the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to ensure reliability.
